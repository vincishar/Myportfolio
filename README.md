My Portfolio page introduces three assignments and two projects along with a link to the Github repo page.The assignments include Giphy API, Friendfinder,Basic-portfolio, and a Trivia game. The projects include Findflix where the user can look up any film based on a genre of their choice by clicking on the picture icon, also an address to the nearest movie thearter based on city location. The next project is a backend site where anyone can register as an active user on our health and wellness site. Similar to a social media account by posting updates on how they reached their goals to improve, networking with other users to seek additional assistance and searching events to attend from eventbrite to provide resources, help or make a difference. Another projet added is a webscraping site where I scraped a news site from Wall Street Journal about real estate property. The user can click on the article and it will take them to the Wall street journal site. In addition save the article from the site and clear it as an option if no longer required. Lastly is my clicky game where the user can play a game clicking on a DC comic superhero image in attempt to reach the highest possible score everytime the images shuffle randomly, and reset to zero when the same image is clicked on twice.
